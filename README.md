# HyperTension_Prediction 
**Project Overview**

Hypertension (high blood pressure) is one of the most common chronic conditions worldwide and a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Early prediction can help in preventive care and treatment planning.
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is likely to have hypertension or not, based on health and lifestyle data.

**Introduction**

Hypertension often develops silently without noticeable symptoms, which makes early detection crucial. By analyzing features such as age, BMI, lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity), and medical history, we can build predictive models that assist in risk stratification.

**Model Used**
**Logistic Regression** : Baseline linear classifier

**Technologies and Tools**
Programming Language : Python 3
Libraries : Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Environment : Jupyter Notebook

**Project Description**
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Prediction on new data

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in predicting hypertension risk using health and lifestyle data.
1.Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy among tested models.
2.The workflow can be extended with larger datasets, additional clinical features, and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
3.Such predictive tools could support healthcare professionals in early screening and preventive strategies.
